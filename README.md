# influence-LT
This is a program which predicts the diffusion of influence in a network operating under the Linear Threshold Model. With these predictions, one can also figure out the most efficient way to change the probability that an individual is influenced through manipulation of that individual's connections. By effectively utilizing individual relationships in large networks, these programs can be eventually used in applications such as disease control, marketing, and social media.
